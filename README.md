# Aseprite-Importer for Unity

This package helps you importing .ase files from aseprite. The reader is fully written in C# which reads the compressed binary file and creates spritesheets out of it.

## Usage
Import the ```AsepriteImporter``` folder into your project. Now it should import all newly added .ase-files automatically. Already imported assets do need a manual re-import.
